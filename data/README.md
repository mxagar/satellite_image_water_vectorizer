# Datasets

This folder contains the links to the dataset, which can be downloaded from the following URL on Google Drive:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u9zbYNrakPoNVV6bhDj9U2TDEmAAT_Bw?usp=share_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u9zbYNrakPoNVV6bhDj9U2TDEmAAT_Bw?usp=share_link)

After downloading the contents, the folders `scene_1` and `scene_2` should be placed in the folder where this `README.md` is located.

Also, note that you can manually download your own dataset from [Copernicus](https://scihub.copernicus.eu). A detailed guide on how to do it can be obtained [here](https://gisgeography.com/how-to-download-sentinel-satellite-data/).

The notebook [`Setup.ipynb`](../notebooks/Setup.ipynb) performs a preliminary analysis of the satellite bands images; additionally, the Regions of Interest (ROIs) and target lake points are defined in that notebook after a visual inspection of the scenes.
